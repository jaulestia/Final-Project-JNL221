    <h1> Commonly Used Firearms Found in Mass Shootings</h1>

  </div>

  <div class= "Subheading">

    <p >About halfway into the year 2023 and there have been more mass shootings than days. United States of America has faced at least 190 mass shootings according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/query/0484b316-f676-44bc-97ed-ecefeabae077/map">Gun Violence Archive</a>. The increasing number of incidents has fueled numerous movements and debates regarding gun control around the nation. This leads to the question: What firearms need control?</p> </div>

  <p> <strong>SYRACUSE, N.Y. </strong> – With every gun control debate the main argument is enforcing firearm regulation in manufacturing, sales, transfer, possession, modification or if civilians should possess them. All thought to be the best way to prevent these incidents from happening again or to at least decrease the probability. But mass shootings have existed for a while and so have firearms. With time they have changed, firearms being remodeled and improved along with the different trends offenders follow during the events. </p>

<p> Some definitions to consider before moving on:</p>

<p><strong>Mass Public shootings</strong> is defined as <em>“a multiple homicide incident in which four or more victims are murdered with firearms—not including the offender(s)—within one event, and at least some of the murders occurred in a public location or locations in close geographical proximity (e.g., a workplace, school, restaurant, or other public settings), and the murders are not attributable to any other underlying criminal activity or commonplace circumstance (armed robbery, criminal competition, insurance fraud, argument, or romantic triangle”</em>according to the Congress Research Service.</p>

<p>A disclaimer to the definition above is that it holds limitations and does not always accurately describe every mass public shooting. In fact, there are many factors that influence the definition of whether four or more people are killed in public is reached.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/">The Violence Project</a> defines the terms below as:</p>

<p><strong>Handgun</strong> is defined as having a short barrel.</p>
 
<p><strong>Shotgun</strong> is defined as having a long barrel and usually having a smooth bore.</p>

<p><strong>Rifle</strong> is defined as having a long barrel with rifling, which puts spin on the bullet, increasing accuracy and distance.</p>

<p><strong>Assault Weapon</strong> is defined as any semi-automatic gun that can accept a detachable ammunition magazine that has one or more additional features considered useful in military and criminal applications but unnecessary for sports or self-defense, such as a folding, telescoping or thumbhole rifle stock. </p>

<p> The terms above represent the classification of firearms most found during mass public shootings. With every mass public shooting, everything about the firearms is studied and an area that is mainly focused is always the classification. What type of firearm was it and how much damage did it do. The circumstances are not always the same in every situation and not every firearm is used in the incident. Understandably the definitions are also limiting as under each classification a variation of firearms fall under the category not providing a specific firearm.  </p>

<div class="Data">
<h2> The Data</h2>
</div>

<div class="Story-body">
<p> Using a dataset from <a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/">The Violence Project</a> where they have recorded every mass public shooting starting with the 1966 University of Texas tower shooting—not because this was the first mass public shooting, but because it was the first modern mass public shooting. The events unfolded live on radio and television and mass shootings since then have received sufficient news coverage to be able to reconstruct and study them.</p>

<p> Notably, the handgun classification has been found the most used or present in mass shootings since 1966 unlike the others. And a lot of outside factors need to be considered when understanding the why’s of this issue. Handguns are the most common due to how easy they are to conceal and just because throughout history, they have been the most relied on firearm, according to Matthew T Kurimsky, a Syracuse Adjunct Professor and expert on firearms. “The basic body armor that we all get is basically oriented toward handgun threats because we know that is historically been the most common type of firearm bad guys use. Not say that they don't use others they do,” he said.  These alleged perpetrators approach the situation not trying to get caught and the best firearm that achieves that is the handgun, Kurimsky elaborates. Handguns can help these individuals get through most instances where long firearms can’t, which contribute to why maybe they are the more common ones. </p>

<p> “It's not because they're the most effective weapon, actually against a man size creature. handguns are pretty anemic,” said Kurimsky. The amount of energy delivered from a handgun does not amount to what a shotgun and rifle can, and the damages are very different. </p>

<p>This debate then doesn’t just argue what firearm needs control but also will laws help prevent these incidents from occurring again all around the nation. </p>

</script>
</div>
<p>Laws aren’t the only factors that need to be considered when wanting to end mass public shootings, Kurimsky believes. According to <a href="https://www.theviolenceproject.org/mass-shooter-database/">The Violence Project</a> data, since 1966 California and Texas hold the most mass public shootings that have occurred. Two states with very opposite gun laws have a significant number of mass public shootings. “And yet you can see there's an example of one state that has extremely strict laws, one that has rather lacks laws and they both have very high mass shooting stats based on this study,” Kurimsky said. Its more than just laws, but also the community, the life of the individuals, so many factors what are not considered when arguing gun control. </p>

<p>“One group will say you just have to get rid of all the firearms and all the mass shootings. And the other group literally say the reason you have mass shootings is because you don't have enough confidence that if you gave everybody a gun, then you wouldn't have mass shootings because these events almost always take place in areas where the shooter has selected a spot where they have a reasonable suspicion that there will be no armed response during their shooting,” Kurimsky explained how the two sides think it is. </p>

<div class="Conclusion">
<h2> What Next?</h2>
</div>


<p>Laws are only a piece of the whole issue because one fails to think of why someone did it. What pushed this individual to go and commit the mass shooting. What was going on in the individual’s life, mind, or state that pushed them to act the way they did. The debate lacks to consider what role these outside factors had. </p>

<p> The rising numbers of mass shootings in the United States is alarming and the progression is concerning. There are always two sides to an argument, and in gun control, both sides have their right to stand where they think they should. The issue of gun control is more than just what one wants and what the other wants but should be more about what would benefit the population. With that in mind, new approaches to this debate should take into consideration more than the firearms but all the other factors that directly or indirectly contribute to the incidents.  </p>
